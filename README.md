# matroids_analysis
Preliminary attempts to apply scikit-learn to binary matroids and discover patterns in the data.

The script `src/process.py` will take a binary matroid data file and output a json blob.
I've done some analysis so far in `src/gaussiannb.py` but I will probably need to switch to a more sophisticated classfier by the time I'm done.
